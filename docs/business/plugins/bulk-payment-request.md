# Bulk Payment Request

The Bulk Payment Request plugin lets you send [payment requests](./payment-request.md) to multiple customers at once by uploading a CSV file. It also supports recurring requests, so you can schedule periodic payment links automatically — no manual effort required.

## Creating a Bulk Payment Request

### Step 1: Open the Bulk Upload

From the Ottu Dashboard, navigate to the **Bulk** tab and click **Upload**.

### Step 2: Download a Sample File

Before preparing your data, download one of the sample CSV files to see the required format. The following templates are available:

| Template | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Required fields** | One-time requests with only mandatory columns |
| **All fields** | One-time requests with all available columns |
| **[Recurrence] required fields** | Recurring requests with only mandatory columns |
| **[Recurrence] all fields** | Recurring requests with all available columns |

### Step 3: Prepare the CSV File

Fill in customer details in the CSV file. Required columns include:

- **Amount** — Payment amount
- **Currency code** — Three-letter currency code (e.g., KWD, SAR, BHD)
- **Language** — Preferred language for the payment page
- **Customer email** — Recipient's email address
- **SMS notification** — Set to `TRUE` to send an SMS, `FALSE` to skip

For recurring templates, you also need to specify:

- **Start date** — When the first payment request is sent
- **End date** — When the recurring cycle stops

### Step 4: Import and Verify

1. Click the **IMPORT** button and select your prepared CSV file.

2. Click on the imported file to review the generated list. Verify that all entries are correct.

3. If errors are detected, Ottu displays an error report. You can download the error file, correct the issues, and re-import.

:::warning
Always review the imported list before dispatching. Errors in email addresses or amounts cannot be corrected after payment links are sent.

### Step 5: Dispatch Payment Links

Once the file looks correct:

1. In the files window, click the **three-dot menu** in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Dispatch**.

This automatically generates payment links for each row and schedules any recurring payments.

:::tip
Use the recurring format when you need to collect regular payments — for example, monthly subscription fees or installment plans. The system handles re-sending automatically.
